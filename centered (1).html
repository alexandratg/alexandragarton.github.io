      I broke this into variables so there's less confusion. :)

      The DOM's innerHeight property tells you the height of the
      browser windwow. The clientHeight tells you the height of
      the element you are asking about (in this case, header).

      To center the header, we need to find out how big it is,
      subtract that from the height of the window and divide by
      two.

      A mistake I *always* make: When you apply the calculation
      to a given style (in this case, marginTop), always make sure
      to append a string, "px". Without the unit of measurement
      it will not work!

      var windowHeight = window.innerHeight;
      var header = document.querySelector("header");
      var headerHeight = header.clientHeight;
      header.style.marginTop = ((windowHeight - headerHeight) / 2) + "px";
